<Accordion defaultOpen title="Don't have a Fastify project yet to add Trigger.dev to? No problem, you can complete the Manual Setup using a blank Fastify project:">
Create a blank project by creating a new Fastify application:

Step 1: Create a new directory

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-fastify-server
cd my-fastify-server
```

Step 2: Initialize your Node.js application

In your project directory, initialize your Node.js application:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory. This file holds various metadata relevant to the project.

Step 3: Install Fastify

Now, install Fastify by typing:

```bash
npm install fastify
```

Step 4: Create your server file

Create a new file in your project directory named `server.js` (or whatever you prefer) and open it in your text editor.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

Trigger.dev works with Fastify applications.

Step 5 (Optional): TypeScript setup

Install `typescript` and `ts-node` packages

```bash
npm install typescript ts-node
```

Inside the `package.json` file, add the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node ./dist/server.js",
    "dev": "ts-node ./src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc"
}
```

Remember to change the paths in the `start` and `dev` script if you have followed a different folder structure

Now, create a file named `tsconfig.json` at the root of your project and add the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ES2019"],
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "strict": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "target": "ES2019",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "strictNullChecks": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": false
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

</Accordion>

## Installing Required Packages

To begin, install the necessary packages in your Fastify project directory:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm

npm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/fastify

```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/fastify

```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/fastify

```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>Ensure that you execute this command within a Fastify project.</Note>

## Obtaining the Development API Key

To locate your development API key, login to the [Trigger.dev
dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev) and select the Project you want to
connect to. Then click on the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu.
You can copy your development API Key from the field at the top of this page.
(Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).

## Adding Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and include your Trigger API key and URL like this:

```bash

TRIGGER_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE
TRIGGER_API_URL=https://cloud.trigger.dev

```

Replace `ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.

## Configuring the Trigger Client

To set up the Trigger Client for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Create Configuration File:**

   In your project directory, create a configuration file named `trigger.ts`.

2. **Add Configuration Code:**

   Open the configuration file you created and add the following code:

   ```typescript
   // trigger.ts (for TypeScript) or trigger.js (for JavaScript)

   import { TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

   export const client = new TriggerClient({
     id: "my-app",
     apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
     apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
   });
   ```

   Replace **"my-app"** with an appropriate identifier for your project. The **apiKey** and **apiUrl** are obtained from the environment variables you set earlier.

By following these steps, you'll configure the Trigger Client to work with your Fastify project.

## Creating a Middleware for Trigger.dev

To establish an API route for interacting with Trigger.dev, follow these steps:

In `server.(js/ts)` create a middleware for the specific `/api/trigger` route.

```ts
// In server.(js/ts)
import fastify from "fastify";
import { createMiddleware } from "@trigger.dev/fastify";
import { client } from "./trigger";

const app = fastify({
  logger: true,
});

const middleware = createMiddleware(client);

app.addHook("preHandler", middleware);

app.listen({ port: 3000 }, () => {
  console.log("Listening on port 3000");
});
```

Make sure to update the path in the `import { client } from './trigger';` statement to match the location of your Trigger Client configuration file.

## Creating the Example Job

1. Create a folder named `Jobs` alongside your Fastify project files.
2. Inside the `Jobs` folder, add two files named `example.js` and `index.js`.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript example.(js/ts)
const { eventTrigger } = require("@trigger.dev/sdk");
const { client } = require("./trigger"); // Update the path as per your project structure

// Your first job
client.defineJob({
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

```typescript index.ts/index.(ts/js)
// import all your job files here

module.exports = require("./example");
```

</CodeGroup>

## Adding Configuration to `package.json`

Inside the `package.json` file, add the following configuration under the root object:

```json
"trigger.dev": {
  "endpointId": "my-app"
}
```

Your `package.json` file might look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "trigger.dev": {
    "endpointId": "my-app"
  }
}
```

Replace **"my-app"** with the appropriate identifier you used during the step for creating the Trigger Client.

## Next Steps

Start your Fastify project, and your Trigger.dev integration should work seamlessly

In your project directory, run

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm

npm run dev

```

```bash pnpm
pnpm run dev

```

```bash yarn
yarn run dev

```

</CodeGroup>

This command starts your Fastify server and enables the Trigger.dev integration

<Warning>
  Ensure your Fastify server is running locally before continuing. You must also leave this server
  running while you develop.
</Warning>

In a **new terminal window or tab**, you can run Trigger.dev locally:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
   You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on port 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end.
</Note>
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the hostname if you're not running on localhost by adding
  `--hostname <host>`. Example, in case your Fastify server is running on 0.0.0.0: `--hostname 0.0.0.0`.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If your existing Fastify project utilizes middleware and you encounter any issues, such as
  potential conflicts with Trigger.dev, it's recommended to refer to the troubleshooting guide at
  [Middleware](/documentation/guides/platforms/Fastify#middleware) for assistance. This guide can
  help you address any concerns related to middleware conflicts and ensure the smooth functioning of
  your project with Trigger.dev.
